## Performance & Resource Efficiency

</div>

jcode is built to built to be as performant and resource efficient as possible. Every metric is optimized to the bone, which is importnat for scaling multi-session workflows. 

<!-- Add performance demo thumbnail/video link here: spawning many jcode instances and using them in parallel. -->

### Headline numbers

- **1 active session:** **~28 MB RSS** for jcode vs **~168 MB** for pi vs **~377 MB** for opencode vs **~677 MB** for Claude Code
- **10 active sessions:** **~433 MB RSS / ~141 MB PSS** total for jcode
- **10 active sessions:** **~1555 MB RSS / ~1011 MB PSS** total for pi
- **10 active sessions:** **~3665 MB RSS / ~3135 MB PSS** total for opencode
- **10 active sessions:** **~4881 MB RSS / ~3460 MB PSS** total for Claude Code
- **Scaling at 10 sessions:** jcode used **~3.6× less RSS than pi**, **~8.5× less than opencode**, and **~11.3× less than Claude Code**

### Memory benchmarks: 10 simultaneous sessions

Measured on this Linux machine using real interactive PTY sessions and Linux `/proc` memory stats. For jcode, the number includes both client memory and the incremental memory growth of the shared server, which is the fair comparison for many active sessions.

Versions tested:

- `jcode v0.8.16-dev (161f9fa)`
- `pi-coding-agent 0.62.0` (`pi`)
- `opencode 1.0.203`
- `Claude Code 2.1.86`

### Interactive startup time

Measured as median **time to first terminal output** across 10 PTY launches on this Linux machine.

<div align="center">

| Tool | Median startup | Range |
|---|---:|---:|
| **jcode** | **13.6 ms** | 9.0–16.9 ms |
| **Claude Code** | **331.1 ms** | 274.5–466.1 ms |
| **pi** | **603.9 ms** | 522.3–701.4 ms |
| **opencode** | **908.9 ms** | 785.5–1014.6 ms |

</div>

<div align="center">

| Tool | 1 active session | 10 active sessions | Avg per session at 10 | Architecture |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **jcode** | **28.2 MB RSS** / **8.9 MB PSS** | **433.3 MB RSS** / **140.7 MB PSS** | **43.3 MB RSS** / **14.1 MB PSS** | shared server + lightweight clients |
| **pi** | **168.4 MB RSS** / **156.2 MB PSS** | **1554.9 MB RSS** / **1010.6 MB PSS** | **155.5 MB RSS** / **101.1 MB PSS** | mostly per-session Node process |
| **opencode** | **377.0 MB RSS** / **372.6 MB PSS** | **3665.2 MB RSS** / **3135.1 MB PSS** | **366.5 MB RSS** / **313.5 MB PSS** | mostly per-session monolith |
| **Claude Code** | **677.0 MB RSS** / **674.1 MB PSS** | **4880.9 MB RSS** / **3460.2 MB PSS** | **488.1 MB RSS** / **346.0 MB PSS** | mostly per-session monolith |

</div>

### Additional memory per added session

<div align="center">

| Tool | Extra RSS per added session | Extra PSS per added session |
|---|---:|---:|
| **jcode** | **~45.0 MB** | **~14.6 MB** |
| **pi** | **~154.1 MB** | **~94.9 MB** |
| **opencode** | **~365.4 MB** | **~306.9 MB** |
| **Claude Code** | **~467.1 MB** | **~309.6 MB** |

</div>

For keeping many sessions open at once, the important number is the 10-session total: on this machine, jcode used roughly **7.2× less PSS than pi**, **22× less PSS than opencode**, and **25× less PSS than Claude Code**.

## Memory

Persistent memory lets jcode remember facts, preferences, entities, and corrections across sessions.

---

## Side Panel and Generated UI

The side panel can render linked markdown, diagrams, and generated visual output directly inside the terminal workflow.

To make this possible, I created a new mermaid rendering library to render diagrams 1800x faster. It has no browser or Typescript dependency. See https://github.com/1jehuang/mermaid-rs-renderer

---

## Swarm

Swarm mode lets multiple agents coordinate inside the same repo with messaging, task sharing, and conflict-aware collaboration.

<!-- Add swarm demo thumbnail/video and fuller writeup here. -->

---

## OAuth and Providers

jcode works with subscription-backed OAuth flows and multiple providers, so you can use the models you already pay for.

<!-- Add OAuth / provider demo thumbnail/video and fuller writeup here. -->

---

## Self-Dev

jcode is the most customizable coding agent. Why? Because you can just modify the source code directly. Tell your jcode agent to enter self dev mode, and it will start modifying its own source code. Jcode is optimized to iterate on itself. There is significant infrastrucutre around self developement, including being able to make changes, test, build, and hot reload, fully automously without breaking your flow.

## iOS Application for Native OpenClaw

A native iOS implementation of OpenClaw is coming soon.

<!-- Add iOS / native OpenClaw preview and fuller writeup here. -->

---

<div align="center">

## Quick Start

</div>

```bash
# Launch the TUI
jcode

# Run a single command non-interactively
jcode run "say hello"

# Resume a previous session by memorable name
jcode --resume fox

# Run as a persistent background server, then attach more clients
jcode serve
jcode connect

# Send voice input from your configured STT command
jcode dictate
```

jcode supports interactive TUI use, non-interactive runs, persistent server/client workflows,
and hotkey-friendly dictation without requiring a bundled speech-to-text stack.

## Detailed Installation

### Setup

If you want another agent to set up jcode for you, give it this prompt:

```text
Set up jcode on this machine for me.

1. Detect the operating system, available package managers, and shell environment, then install jcode using the best matching command below instead of referring me somewhere else:

   - macOS with Homebrew available:
     brew tap 1jehuang/jcode
     brew install jcode

   - macOS or Linux via install script:
     curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1jehuang/jcode/master/scripts/install.sh | bash

   - Windows PowerShell:
     irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1jehuang/jcode/master/scripts/install.ps1 | iex

   - From source if the above paths are not appropriate:
     git clone https://github.com/1jehuang/jcode.git
     cd jcode
     cargo build --release
     scripts/install_release.sh

   - For local self-dev / refactor work on Linux x86_64, prefer:
     scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --release -p jcode --bin jcode
     scripts/dev_cargo.sh --print-setup
     scripts/install_release.sh

2. Verify that `jcode` is on my `PATH`.
3. Launch `jcode` once in a new terminal window/session to confirm it starts successfully.
4. Before attempting any interactive login flow, assess which providers are already available non-interactively and prefer those first. Check existing local credentials, config files, CLI sessions, and environment variables such as:
   - Claude: `~/.jcode/auth.json`, `~/.claude/.credentials.json`, `~/.local/share/opencode/auth.json`, `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
   - OpenAI: `~/.jcode/openai-auth.json`, `~/.codex/auth.json`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`
   - Gemini: `~/.jcode/gemini_oauth.json`, `~/.gemini/oauth_creds.json`
   - GitHub Copilot: existing auth under `~/.config/github-copilot/`
   - Azure OpenAI: `~/.config/jcode/azure-openai.env`, `AZURE_OPENAI_*`, or an existing `az login`
   - OpenRouter: `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
   - Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan: existing jcode config/env if present
5. Prefer whichever provider is already configured and verify it with `jcode auth-test --all-configured` or a provider-specific auth test when appropriate.
6. Only if no usable provider is already configured, guide me through the minimal manual step needed:
   - Claude: `jcode login --provider claude`
   - GitHub Copilot: `jcode login --provider copilot`
   - OpenAI: `jcode login --provider openai`
   - Gemini: `jcode login --provider gemini`
   - Azure OpenAI: `jcode login --provider azure`
   - Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan: `jcode login --provider alibaba-coding-plan`
   - OpenRouter: help me set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
   - Anthropic direct API: help me set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`
7. After setup, run a simple smoke test with `jcode run "say hello"` and confirm it works.
8. Explain any manual step that still needs me, especially browser OAuth, device login, or API key entry.
```

This is intended to be a copy-paste bootstrap prompt for jcode itself or any other coding agent.

### Quick Install

```bash
# macOS & Linux
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1jehuang/jcode/master/scripts/install.sh | bash
```

```powershell
# Windows (PowerShell)
irm https://raw.githubusercontent.com/1jehuang/jcode/master/scripts/install.ps1 | iex
```

### macOS via Homebrew

```bash
brew tap 1jehuang/jcode
brew install jcode
```

### From Source (all platforms)

```bash
git clone https://github.com/1jehuang/jcode.git
cd jcode
cargo build --release
```

For local self-dev / refactor work on Linux x86_64, prefer:

```bash
scripts/dev_cargo.sh build --release -p jcode --bin jcode
scripts/dev_cargo.sh --print-setup
```

That wrapper automatically uses `sccache` when available, prefers a fast
working local linker setup (`clang + lld`) instead of assuming every machine's
`mold` configuration is valid, and can print the active linker/cache setup via
`--print-setup` so slow-path builds are easier to diagnose.

Then symlink to your PATH:

```bash
scripts/install_release.sh
```

### Prerequisites

You need at least one of:

| Provider | Setup |
|---|---|
| **Claude** (recommended) | Run `/login claude` inside jcode (opens browser for OAuth) |
| **GitHub Copilot** | Run `/login copilot` inside jcode (GitHub device flow) |
| **OpenAI** | Run `/login openai` inside jcode (opens browser for OAuth) |
| **Google Gemini** | Run `/login gemini` inside jcode (native Google OAuth for Code Assist) |
| **Azure OpenAI** | Run `jcode login --provider azure` (Microsoft Entra ID or API key) |
| **Alibaba Cloud Coding Plan** | Run `jcode login --provider alibaba-coding-plan` (Alibaba Cloud Bailian API key) |
| **OpenRouter** | Set `OPENROUTER_API_KEY=sk-or-v1-...` |
| **Direct API Key** | Set `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=sk-ant-...` |

### Platform Support

| Platform | Status |
|---|---|
| **Linux** x86_64 / aarch64 | Fully supported |
| **macOS** Apple Silicon & Intel | Supported |
| **Windows** x86_64 | Supported (native + WSL2) |
