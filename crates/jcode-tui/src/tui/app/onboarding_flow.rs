//! First-run onboarding flow state machine.
//!
//! After the user logs in / imports credentials on a fresh install, we walk
//! them through a short guided flow:
//!
//!   1. `Login` - if we boot without working credentials, ask the
//!      user to log in right inside the TUI (the fresh
//!      install no longer runs a blocking CLI login).
//!      Skipped entirely when credentials already exist.
//!   2. `TranscriptPick` - if we detect external Codex / Claude Code
//!      transcripts, drop the user straight into a
//!      resume-style picker. The picker reserves a top band
//!      for an onboarding prompt and offers a selectable
//!      "Start a new session" row alongside the resumable
//!      sessions. Nothing auto-selects; the user resumes a
//!      session or starts fresh explicitly.
//!   3. `Suggestions` - the existing prompt-suggestion cards. Reached when
//!      they choose "Start a new session", when there is no
//!      external OAuth, or as the terminal resting state.
//!
//!   (`ContinuePrompt` is retained as a legacy phase for replay/test fixtures
//!   but is no longer entered by the live flow.)
//!
//! If anything fails along the continue path (no transcripts, load error,
//! resume failure) we fall back to seeding the input with a prompt that asks
//! the agent to session-search the latest Codex/Claude Code session and
//! continue from there.
