//! Quantifying info-widget movement during scrolling.
//!
//! Info widgets are placed into the "negative space" (free width to the right/left
//! of the rendered text) of the *currently visible* viewport, anchored to absolute
//! screen rows. As the user scrolls, the per-row free-width profile changes line by
//! line, so a widget that fit at one screen position may reflow or jump elsewhere.
//! That reflow is the "distracting movement" users report.
//!
//! This module turns that distraction into deterministic numbers so it can be
//! measured and A/B-tested. It exposes:
//!
//! * [`analyze_frames`] - given the widget placements observed across a sequence of
//!   scroll frames, compute movement/flicker metrics. This is the shared analyzer
//!   used by both the synthetic simulation here and the live debug bench.
//! * [`simulate_scroll`] - drive the real layout algorithm over a synthetic content
//!   width profile, one scroll line at a time, producing the frame sequence.
