//! Process-global registry of cancel signals for actively running turns.
//!
//! Why this exists (issue #428): a cancel (Esc) is delivered through whatever
//! `SessionControlHandle` the receiving connection happens to hold. That
//! handle's stop signal can be a *different* [`InterruptSignal`] instance from
//! the `graceful_shutdown` signal of the agent actually streaming the turn:
//!
//! - re-attach after a reload or disconnect where cleanup removed the
//!   `shutdown_signals` registration,
//! - server-initiated turns (`spawn_tracked_live_turn`, headless recovery,
//!   swarm wake delivery) running on an agent object the connection never
//!   locked,
//! - headless spawns that never registered a shutdown signal,
//! - the lock-free `cancel_only` fallback built while the agent mutex is busy.
//!
//! Firing a stale instance silently does nothing: the client shows
//! "Interrupting..." while the model keeps generating for minutes and every
//! extra Esc only stacks another `Interrupted` event ("Interrupted [x66]").
//!
//! Every turn now registers its own `graceful_shutdown` signal here for the
//! duration of the turn, and `SessionControlHandle::request_cancel` fires
//! every registered signal for the session in addition to its own handle, so
//! cancellation reaches the in-flight provider stream no matter which handle
//! instance received the request.
