//! Provider-doctor diagnostics for jcode.
//!
//! Sits downstream of `jcode-base` so edits to the doctor cluster do not
//! rebuild the base -> app-core -> tui spine:
//! - [`provider_e2e`]: the strict end-to-end runner behind `jcode
//!   provider-doctor` (offline/catalog/full tiers, native + OpenAI-compatible
//!   drivers).
//! - [`live_provider_probes`]: the live HTTP/native-runtime probes the doctor
//!   drives (models fetch, chat, streaming, tool-call smokes).
//! - `lifecycle_driver` (test-only): the auth-lifecycle contract driver and
//!   its provider matrices.
