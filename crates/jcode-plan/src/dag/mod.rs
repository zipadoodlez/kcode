//! Task-DAG engine model.
//!
//! This is the DAG-first reframe of swarm described in `docs/SWARM_TASK_GRAPH.md`.
//! The graph is the primary object: nodes are tasks, edges are dependencies, and
//! agents are fungible workers that execute, decompose (composite nodes), and
//! verify (gate nodes) those tasks.
//!
//! The model here is deliberately decoupled from the server/runtime wiring so it
//! can be exercised end-to-end by the deterministic simulator in [`crate::dag::sim`]
//! before being attached to live swarm sessions.
