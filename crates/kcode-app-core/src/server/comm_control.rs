/// Eligible auto-assignment targets for a swarm task.
///
/// Auto-pick must only land on sessions that will actually *execute* the work
/// without further human action. In a shared swarm there can be many foreign
/// members: independent human TUIs and stale "zombie" sessions left over from
/// other runs. Assigning to those silently strands the task (a human session is
/// never auto-driven; a zombie has no live agent at all) and stalls `run_plan`.
///
/// So a member is only a free worker for *automatic* selection when it is a
/// worker this run owns and can drive:
///
/// - `is_headless`: a spawned in-process worker (always auto-driven), or
/// - owned by the requester (`report_back_to_session_id == req`): a worker this
///   coordinator spawned, including reusable ones that already returned `ready`.
///
/// Everything else (foreign humans, zombies) must be addressed with an explicit
/// `target_session`, which bypasses this filter; this only governs auto-pick.
///
/// The status allowlist is also the whole busy rule: `ready` and `completed`
/// are the idle lifecycle states, and a member that is working or waiting on
/// work (`is_in_flight`, i.e. `queued`/`running`) is never idle. Busy is the
/// member's own in-flight work, so nothing here consults the plan.
///

/// row back to a holder that can take it. Both read [`member_is_idle`].
